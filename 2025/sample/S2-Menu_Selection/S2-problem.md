# Menu Selection (2025 S2, 5 pts)

After a long walk (without touching grass), you’re extremely hungry and head to the nearest McDonald’s to eat some big macs. They give you a menu with k possible big macs, each with a weight wi for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. However, you must select big macs in a way such that no two big macs are within a restricted weight, rw, of each other. Other than this restriction, you can select any combination of big macs. Since you’re tired, you want to eat as much big mac as you can.

## Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers, k, and rw, the number of menu entries and the weight restriction, respectively. The next line contains k space-separated positive integers: the weight wi of the ith big mac (1 ≤ i ≤ k).

## Output
Output the maximum possible total weight of any valid combination of big macs.
